# How to use this

It's simple: You build your gallery out of `<figure>` elements inside the `<div id="slider">`.
Each figure has an image and possibly a title. Like this:
```HTML
<figure>
	<figcaption>The Title</figcaption>
	<img src="path/to.jpg" alt="The Title" />
</figure>
```
Styling is done via simple CSS - use what you like!
